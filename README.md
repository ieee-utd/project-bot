# project-bot
A chat bot developed with Node.js for the Discord messaging platform.
An initiative for strengthening IEEE UTD's online setting in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
***

### Objective
* Provide automated reminders organization events
* Implement an interface for tutors to seamlessly use Discord along with the bot for auto-logging hours

### APIs
* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome)
* [IEEE UTD's Official Website]("https://ieeeutd.org/api/events")

### Project Status
As of now, the bot provides organization events upon command with `$events`. An automated approach is needed.
Auto-logging tutor hours and displaying them for students/members are also needed.

### Setting Up Local Development
* Install project dependencies by running `yarn install`
* Add a `.env` file using the `.env.example` template file
* Start the application by running `yarn start` in your terminal

You're all set for local development! ðŸŽ‰
